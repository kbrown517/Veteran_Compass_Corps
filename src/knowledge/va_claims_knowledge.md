## SECTION 1: COMPENSATION AND PENSION FUNDAMENTALS

### WHAT IS COMPENSATION?
Compensation (disability compensation) is paid by the VA to veterans for disabilities resulting from injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated during active military service. The amount depends on the degree of disability, expressed as a percentage (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, etc., up to 100%).

### WHAT IS PENSION?
Pension is paid to wartime veterans who have limited income and are permanently and totally disabled from non-service-connected conditions, or who are 65 years of age or older.

### KEY DEFINITIONS:

**Service-Connected (SC) Disability:**
A disability resulting from a disease or injury which was incurred or aggravated during a period of active military service from which the veteran was discharged under other than dishonorable conditions. A service-connected disability evaluated 10% or more disabling entitles a veteran to disability compensation.

**Non Service-Connected (NSC) Disability:**
A disability resulting from a disease or injury which was not incurred or aggravated in active military service.

**Rating Veterans Service Representative (RVSR):**
A Veterans Service Center employee who, based on service and medical records, determines whether or not a claimed disability exists, the relationship of the disability to military service, and the degree to which it renders the claimant disabled.

## SECTION 2: THE C&P EXAMINATION PROCESS

### WHAT IS A C&P EXAMINATION?
Many claims filed by veterans for compensation and/or pension necessitate a medical examination. The report of the examination, together with service medical records and other evidence, is used by the VSC to determine eligibility for benefits and level of compensation.

### HOW IS A C&P EXAM DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR MEDICAL EXAM?
A traditional medical examination requires diagnoses for treatment purposes. A C&P disability examination requires diagnoses to prove whether or not a claimed disability actually exists AND the functional effects of the disability on the veteran.

**Key difference:** A treatment examination is written for clinicians to understand. A C&P examination is written for RVSRs, lawyers, and judges to understand.

The purpose of the C&P exam is to provide very specific information to ensure a proper evaluation of the claimed disability rather than to provide medical treatment.

### HOW C&P EXAMS ARE CONDUCTED:
1. The examiner reads the VSC request, including any remarks, specific questions, directions, or requested opinions
2. Reviews the claims file, service records, medical records, previous C&P examinations, and BVA Remand if available
3. Explains the examination process to the veteran and confirms the claimed conditions
4. Examines the veteran following the appropriate worksheets for all claimed conditions
5. Orders any required tests and procedures to establish diagnoses for rating purposes
6. Prepares a complete typed report

BVA Remand instructions generally require the examiner to review the claims file and the BVA Remand instructions and to so state in the final report.

### C&P EXAM PREPARATION CHECKLIST:
- Know your claimed conditions and be ready to describe them clearly
- Be prepared to describe how symptoms affect your daily life
- Document the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms
- Bring a list of medications and treatments
- Be honest about good days and bad days
- Do not minimize or exaggerate symptoms
- Describe your worst days, not just average days

### COMMON C&P EXAM MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Minimizing symptoms to appear "tough"
- Not mentioning how conditions affect work, sleep, or relationships
- Forgetting to mention flare-ups
- Not describing functional limitations clearly
- Being vague about symptom frequency

## SECTION 3: HOW RATINGS ARE DETERMINED

### THE RATING SCHEDULE:
The VA uses the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (commonly called the "rating schedule" or "38 CFR Part 4") to evaluate the severity of disabilities. Each condition has specific criteria that correspond to different rating percentages.

### COMBINED RATINGS:
When a veteran has multiple service-connected disabilities, the VA uses a combined ratings formula (not simple addition).

**Example:** A 50% rating and a 30% rating does NOT equal 80%

The VA uses a "whole person" theory where each rating is applied to the remaining "healthy" percentage.

**How it works:**
- Start with 100% efficiency
- Apply first rating: 100% - 50% = 50% remaining efficiency
- Apply second rating to remaining: 50% x 30% = 15%
- Combined: 50% + 15% = 65% (rounded to nearest 10% = 70%)

### BILATERAL FACTOR:
When disabilities affect both arms, both legs, or paired skeletal muscles, a 10% increase is applied before combining.

## SECTION 4: MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

### GENERAL RATING FORMULA FOR MENTAL DISORDERS:
Mental disorders are generally rated under a single General Rating Formula:

- **100%:** Total occupational and social impairment
- **70%:** Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas
- **50%:** Occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity
- **30%:** Occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency
- **10%:** Occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms
- **0%:** Diagnosis of mental disorder, but symptoms not severe enough to interfere with functioning

### KEY FACTORS EVALUATED:
- Mood disturbances (depression, anxiety, irritability)
- Memory problems
- Sleep disturbances
- Social and occupational functioning
- Judgment and abstract thinking
- Speech patterns
- Panic attacks (frequency and severity)
- Difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances
- Suicidal ideation

---

## SECTION 5: PTSD SPECIFIC INFORMATION

### DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA:
For PTSD diagnosis, the following must be present:

A. Exposure to a traumatic event (stressor)
B. Re-experiencing symptoms (intrusive memories, nightmares, flashbacks)
C. Avoidance and numbing symptoms
D. Hyperarousal symptoms (hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, sleep problems)
E. Duration more than one month
F. Clinically significant distress or impairment

### STRESSOR VERIFICATION:
For combat veterans, the VA may presume the stressor occurred if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service. For non-combat stressors, more corroborating evidence may be required.

---

## SECTION 6: MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS

### RANGE OF MOTION:
For joint conditions, the VA evaluates range of motion in degrees. Normal ranges vary by joint:
- Shoulder flexion: 0-180 degrees
- Elbow flexion: 0-145 degrees
- Knee flexion: 0-140 degrees
- Ankle dorsiflexion: 0-20 degrees

### KEY FACTORS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL RATINGS:
- Limitation of motion
- Pain on motion (DeLuca factors)
- Weakness
- Fatigue
- Incoordination
- Flare-ups and their impact
- Functional loss
- Arthritis (requires X-ray confirmation)
- Ankylosis (joint fixed in one position)

### DELUCA FACTORS:
Named after a court case, these factors require consideration of:
- Pain on use
- Weakness
- Fatigability
- Incoordination
- Functional loss during flare-ups

When preparing for a musculoskeletal C&P exam, be prepared to describe:
- How pain affects movement on bad days
- What activities you cannot do or must limit
- How flare-ups affect your function

## SECTION 7: SECONDARY CONDITIONS

### WHAT IS A SECONDARY CONDITION?
A secondary service-connected condition is a disability that was caused by or aggravated by an already service-connected condition.

**Examples:**
- Knee problems causing hip problems due to altered gait
- Medication side effects from treating a service-connected condition
- Depression or anxiety caused by chronic pain from service-connected conditions

### REQUIREMENTS FOR SECONDARY SERVICE CONNECTION:
1. An already service-connected primary condition
2. A current diagnosis of the secondary condition
3. Medical evidence (nexus) linking the secondary condition to the primary condition

---

## SECTION 8: EVIDENCE AND DOCUMENTATION

### TYPES OF EVIDENCE:
1. **Service Treatment Records (STRs):** Medical records from military service
2. **VA Medical Records:** Treatment records from VA facilities
3. **Private Medical Records:** Treatment records from civilian providers
4. **Buddy Statements:** Written statements from fellow service members or witnesses
5. **Personal Statements:** The veteran's own account of symptoms and impact
6. **Nexus Letters:** Medical opinions linking current conditions to service

### WHAT MAKES STRONG EVIDENCE:
- Contemporaneous records (documented at or near the time of events)
- Consistent reports over time
- Medical professional opinions with clear rationale
- Objective testing results
- Documentation of functional impact

---

## SECTION 9: THE APPEALS PROCESS

### CURRENT APPEALS SYSTEM (AMA - Appeals Modernization Act):
After receiving an unfavorable decision, veterans have three lane options:

1. **Supplemental Claim Lane**
   - Submit new and relevant evidence
   - VA reviews with the new evidence

2. **Higher-Level Review Lane**
   - Request review by a more senior adjudicator
   - No new evidence allowed
   - Can identify clear and unmistakable error

3. **Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA)**
   - Appeal to the Board
   - Three docket options: Direct Review, Evidence, Hearing
   - Can submit additional evidence on Evidence or Hearing dockets

**Decision Review Officer (DRO):**
A Veterans Service Center employee who may conduct personal hearings with veterans who disagree with a VSC decision.

**Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC):**
CAVC has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the BVA. The Court's precedent decisions are binding upon the entire Department of Veterans Affairs.

## SECTION 10: SPECIAL MONTHLY COMPENSATION

### HOUSEBOUND:
An additional amount of money payable monthly to a veteran receiving compensation or pension. Paid if the claimant, due to disability, is factually housebound (substantially confined to dwelling and immediate premises).

### AID AND ATTENDANCE:
A higher level of special monthly compensation for veterans who require the regular aid and attendance of another person to perform activities of daily living.

---

## SECTION 11: DISABILITY BENEFITS QUESTIONNAIRES (DBQs)

### WHAT ARE DBQs?
Disability Benefits Questionnaires are standardized forms that capture the medical information needed to evaluate disability claims. They ensure consistent and complete medical evidence.

### HOW DBQs ARE USED:
- C&P examiners complete them during examinations
- Private physicians can also complete them
- They follow specific worksheets for each condition type
- They capture objective findings, functional limitations, and diagnostic information

---

## SECTION 12: IMPORTANT TIMEFRAMES

### KEY DEADLINES:
- **1 year from decision:** Time to appeal or file supplemental claim to preserve effective date
- **1 year from discharge:** Presumptive period for some conditions
- Various presumptive periods for specific conditions (varies by condition and era of service)

### EFFECTIVE DATES:
The effective date determines when benefits begin. Generally:
- Date of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later
- Can be earlier if within 1 year of separation and condition existed in service

---

## SECTION 13: DECISION REVIEW PROCESS (AMA)

### THE MODERNIZED DECISION REVIEW PROCESS:
When veterans disagree with a VA decision, they have three options under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). If you continuously pursue your claim through one of these lanes, your effective date remains protected.

### OPTION 1: SUPPLEMENTAL CLAIM
- **Use when:** You have new and relevant evidence to add
- **What happens:** VA will assist in gathering evidence. A reviewer looks at all evidence and determines if it changes the decision
- **Timeline:** Approximately 125 days from filing
- **Form:** VA Form 20-0995

### OPTION 2: HIGHER-LEVEL REVIEW
- **Use when:** You believe VA made an error or you want a senior reviewer to look at the same evidence
- **What happens:** A senior reviewer examines evidence already on file. No new evidence can be submitted. You may request an informal conference to explain why the decision should change
- **Timeline:** Approximately 125 days from filing
- **Form:** VA Form 20-0996

### OPTION 3: BOARD OF VETERANS APPEALS
- **Use when:** You want a Veterans Law Judge to review your case
- **Three sub-options:**
  1. **Direct Review:** No hearing, no new evidence
  2. **Evidence Submission:** Submit new evidence within 90 days, no hearing
  3. **Hearing:** Appear before a judge, can submit evidence within 90 days after hearing
- **Form:** VA Form 10182

### WHAT IF YOU MISS THE DEADLINE?
If you do not request a review within 1 year of the decision:
- You can still file a Supplemental Claim with new and relevant evidence
- However, the effective date will generally be tied to when VA receives the supplemental claim (not the original claim date)
